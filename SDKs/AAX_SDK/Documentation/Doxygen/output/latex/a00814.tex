The interface for a AAX Plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s user interface. 

The \mbox{\hyperlink{a02109}{GUI interface}} includes methods for handling the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s GUI window and events.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Accessing the window}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
In AAX, the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s window is provided as a native window pointer through the \mbox{\hyperlink{a02177}{AAX\+\_\+\+IView\+Container}} interface. The plug-\/in may also use this interface to forward events in its window back to the host for handling.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Default implementation}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
A default implementation of the GUI interface, \mbox{\hyperlink{a01757}{AAX\+\_\+\+CEffect\+GUI}}, is compiled in to the AAX library. This class includes a few helper methods and other extensions to the base interface. Of particular note are several additional pure virtual methods that are used by this class to extend the GUI API, and which must be overridden by any inheriting class.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Extensions}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
The AAX SDK includes several examples of how the basic GUI interface may be extended to support native or third-\/party GUI frameworks. These examples are not a core part of the SDK, but are provided to developers as a convenience when incorporating their own chosen GUI framework. \doxysubsection*{Classes}
