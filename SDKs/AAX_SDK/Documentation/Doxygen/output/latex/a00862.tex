Demo\+MIDI\+\_\+\+Sampler\+: No audio on right channel (multi-\/mono)

Resolution\+: This bug is fixed as of AAX SDK 2.\+2.\+0

Discussion\+: Demo\+MIDI\+\_\+\+Sampler and Demo\+MIDI\+\_\+\+Synth are now restricted to not use multi-\/mono, via the \mbox{\hyperlink{a00674_a13e384f22825afd3db6d68395b79ce0da83f671685958bdc668ef574d5a2d92b0}{AAX\+\_\+e\+Property\+\_\+\+Constraint\+\_\+\+Multi\+Mono\+Support}} property.

In Pro Tools, when a track\textquotesingle{}s MIDI destination is set to \char`\"{}none\char`\"{} and a new plug-\/in that includes a MIDI input node (e.\+g. any Instrument plug-\/in) is instantiated, the track\textquotesingle{}s MIDI destination is set to the first newly created MIDI input node.

When the track in question is greater than mono, and the Instrument plug-\/in is multi-\/mono, the default behavior is for the track\textquotesingle{}s MIDI destination to be set to the first of the newly created input nodes, not to all of them simultaneously. As a result, the track\textquotesingle{}s MIDI destination is set to the MIDI input node of the first (left) multi-\/mono instance of the plug-\/in.

To route MIDI to all channels of a multi-\/mono plug-\/in in Pro Tools, ctrl-\/select the MIDI destination and choose the additional MIDI nodes.\hypertarget{a00862_AAXSDK-186}{}\doxysubsubsection{AAXSDK-\/186}\label{a00862_AAXSDK-186}

AAX Demo\+Gain\+\_\+\+VST and Demo\+Gain\+\_\+\+Cocoa require initial click on GUI to take focus before editing (OS X)

Resolution\+: This bug is not yet resolved. For OS X, one workaround is to modify VSTGUI\textquotesingle{}s cocoasupport.\+mm file in order to add a handler for the accepts\+First\+Mouse selector\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}

AAX SDK\+: Incorrect output from scatter/gather DMA example plug-\/in when increasing playback buffer size while audio is present (Native decks)

Resolution\+: This bug is unresolved

Workaround\+: The workaround for this issue is to not run audio through this plug-\/in while increasing the playback buffer size.\hypertarget{a00862_AAXSDK-5}{}\doxysubsubsection{AAXSDK-\/5}\label{a00862_AAXSDK-5}

Resolution\+: This bug will not be fixed

Discussion\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{a01741}{AAX\+\_\+\+CChunk\+Data\+Parser}} does not store the size of each chunk item in the data stream. Therefore there is no way to determine the correct size for each data element when reading a chunk that was generated by this parser.

Workaround\+: If you know the correct size of each data element in a chunk when it is read by the plug-\/in, you can override the \mbox{\hyperlink{a01741}{AAX\+\_\+\+CChunk\+Data\+Parser}} methods to ensure that each data element is correctly sized.\hypertarget{a00862_AAXSDK-2}{}\doxysubsubsection{AAXSDK-\/2 / AAX-\/648}\label{a00862_AAXSDK-2}

The workaround for this issue is to modify the group\textquotesingle{}s settings to de-\/select \char`\"{}follow globals\char`\"{}, then re-\/modify the group\textquotesingle{}s settings to select \char`\"{}follow globals\char`\"{}. This will apply the current Globals settings as well as any future changes to the Globals without need for additional workarounds.\hypertarget{a00862_AAX-686}{}\doxysubsubsection{AAX-\/686}\label{a00862_AAX-686}

Plug-\/in installers cannot associate a single thumbnail image with multiple variants

Resolution\+: This capability is supported starting in Venue 6.\+3

Prior to this change a plug-\/in thumbnail filename always contained 24 hexadecimal digits\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The first 8 digits refer to the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s Manufacturer ID  
\item The middle 8 digits refer to the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s Product ID  
\item The last 8 digits refer to the plug-\/in\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}plug-\/in ID\char`\"{}, which is usually a plug-\/in variant (Mono, Stereo, etc.).  
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

With this change, Venue supports using a generic thumbnail file for all variants, thus having only the first 16 identifying digits.\hypertarget{a00862_VSW-13292}{}\doxysubsubsection{VSW-\/13292}\label{a00862_VSW-13292}
Plug-\/in parameters are not mapped to S6L if custom page tables are not provided

Details\+: S6L does not fall back to using the {\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}Pg\+TL\textquotesingle{}} page table type if a plug-\/in does not provide any parameter mapping for the primary {\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}Av46\textquotesingle{}} or secondary {\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}Fr\+TL\textquotesingle{}} page tables. If a plug-\/in does not provide any of these page tables then its parameters will not display on the console.

Optional analysis is not applied to every channel in a multi-\/channel selection

Resolution\+: This bug is fixed as of Media Composer 8.\+4

Discussion\+: When an optional analysis pass is triggered in Media Composer, only the channel that is currently represented in the Audio\+Suite Dialog will be analyzed. Other channels in a multi-\/channel selection will not be analyzed.

This issue is fixed in Media Composer 8.\+4; now the following behavior will occur for Audio\+Suite plug-\/ins\+:
