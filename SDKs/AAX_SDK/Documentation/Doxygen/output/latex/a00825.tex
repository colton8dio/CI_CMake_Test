\hypertarget{a00825_alg_dma_overview}{}\doxysubsection{DMA facility overview}\label{a00825_alg_dma_overview}
AAX provides an \mbox{\hyperlink{a02097}{abstract interface}} for accessing the host environment\textquotesingle{}s DMA or other memory-\/transfer facilities. All platform-\/specific details are handled by the AAX host environment, allowing plug-\/ins that use this interface to be re-\/targeted to to Native or DSP environments without changing their memory transfer implementation.\hypertarget{a00825_alg_dma_modes}{}\doxysubsection{DMA transfer modes}\label{a00825_alg_dma_modes}
AAX hosts may support the following DMA modes, as listed in \mbox{\hyperlink{a02097_af8d0f19f2896dd6dbd126b919b24e39b}{AAX\+\_\+\+IDma\+::\+EMode}} \+:

This mode is most often used to transfer data from linear internal memory to a large external memory buffer.\end{DoxyItemize}

This mode is most often used to transfer data from an external memory buffer to an internal memory buffer.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In \mbox{\hyperlink{a02097_af8d0f19f2896dd6dbd126b919b24e39ba253c129077dc004dd83cca8931e69eb9}{Burst}} mode, data is written linearly from one location to another. Burst mode transfers may be used for linear transfers of data to or from external memory. During the transfer, the source data is broken into a series of individual bursts. This mode is included for completeness, though the Scatter/\+Gather modes are expected to be more appropriate for the vast majority of real-\/world DMA use cases.\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{a00825_alg_dma_registration}{}\doxysubsection{Registering for DMA transfers}\label{a00825_alg_dma_registration}
Algorithm Components register for DMA transfers by adding one or more DMA fields to their context via \mbox{\hyperlink{a02069_aff9e1c726bbdf500f2d61b164589744e}{AAX\+\_\+\+IComponent\+Descriptor\+::\+Add\+Dma\+Instance()}}. At runtime, each field will be populated with a valid \mbox{\hyperlink{a02097}{DMA interface}} for the specified DMA mode.\hypertarget{a00825_alg_dma_restrictions}{}\doxysubsection{DMA restrictions}\label{a00825_alg_dma_restrictions}
The following restrictions apply to DMA transfers on all AAX platforms\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The maximum burst size for any DMA transfer is 64B. The minimum burst size is 1B. \item Only one DMA transfer request may be posted per \mbox{\hyperlink{a02097}{AAX\+\_\+\+IDma}} object per processing callback. \item Scatter and Gather requests each require that the circular memory buffer be padded by at least the size of one burst\end{DoxyItemize}
